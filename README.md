# CS4320 Machine Learning
This repository contains projects I completed during the CS4320 Machine Learning class at the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics. I took this class in the spring of 2023. It was taught by Dr. Larry Hodges, Chair of Computer Science at the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics and Emeritus Director and Professor in the School of Computing at Clemson University. A coursse description is included below.

This course teaches basic machine learning concepts, algorithms and their applications using Python and associated software libraries. Machine learning concepts include where ML fits within AI, Data Science, and Statistics, where ML is being commonly used, and the larger societal context including possible ethical concerns. Machine learning techniques include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Applications may include implementation of decision trees, neural networks, and other frameworks. This course features a final project allowing students to apply machine learning techniques to a problem of interest to them. This course requires advanced programming skill and expects mastery of the Python programming language as evidenced by meeting the course prerequisite or by placement exam.
